            <h2>Assignment 7: Chrome Developer Tools</h2>
        
            <p>
                Individual assignment.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Choose an existing website of your liking. It can be anything from facebook to amazon, twitter, a tumblr blog you like, or anything else out there.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong class="due-date">You can use this assignment as research for your final project. Look at inspirational examples, figure out how they work, begin taking notes about what you might want to do.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                View the source code and run a comparative analysis between the website and the source. Based on this analysis, write a simple description of how you think the website works, then choose at least <strong class="due-date">three attributes</strong> that you will change, using the chrome developer toolkit. These changes should be inspired by something you wish the developers of your site of choice made different.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Take screenshots of the original website and your modified version, and explain the reasons for your changes.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Build a webpage to host a description of your process and your results.
