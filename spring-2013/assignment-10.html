            <h2>Assignment 10: Final Project Pre-production Document</h2>
            <p>
                Individual or team assignment.
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal of this assignment is to help students refine their design vision before they start building a final project as well as to have them prepare the necessary technical resources and content assets to begin this building process.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point, all content required for the project (text, images, sound, video) should be ready to be used. In case <strong>new content</strong> still needs to be produced, a detailed description and a production schedule should be provided, as well as temporary placeholders to replace it during the initial stages of the final project production.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Proposal Refinement</h4>
                A pre-production document should be presented as an illustrated HTML webpage covering the following sections:
                <ul>
                    <li>Link to a directory with all content or content placeholders</li>
                    <li>Full Detail Landing Page Mockup (photoshop, illustrator, etc)</li> 
                    <li>Wireframes for all the additional sections in the site</li>
                    <li>Site Map with Navigation Storyboard</li>
                    <li>Descriptions of all transitions and interactive elements</li>
                    <li>List of selected javascript plug-ins or add-ons</li>
                    <li>Assessment of scope and production plan (timeline)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <h2>Assignment Due Date</h2>
                <span class="due-date">Assignment 4: Monday, April 1th, 6:00pm.</span>

            <p>
                <h2>Readings</h2>
                There will be no readings this week. Instead of that, write an analysis of the javascript plug-ins or add-ons you're using and how they will improve your design, as well as the top reasons why you chose them. Make this a part of your assignment.
