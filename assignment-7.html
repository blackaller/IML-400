            <h2>Assignment 7: Final Project Concept and Design</h2>
            <p>
                Optional individual or team assignment.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Final Project Proposal Document</h4>
                The proposal document should be presented as a simple illustrated HTML webpage covering the following sections:
                <ul>
                    <li>Letter of intent</li> 
                    <li>Team (optional)</li>
                    <li>Theme and Subject</li>
                    <li>Scope</li>
                    <li>Design</li>
                    <li>Research</li>    

                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Letter of intent</h4>
                A simple paragraph explaining your motivation to work on your project of choice. Describe your own expectations from the finished product and explain the potential benefit you and others can have from it. In addition to this, justify your design choices based on the goal to communicate your subject in an original, optimal manner.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Team</h4>
                Students can team up for their final project. Allowed team size is two or three members. In case you choose to work on your final project as a team, you will be requested to describe in detail each member's participation, and you will be required to use git and github to develop your project. Teams will also be required to explain why they think their project will benefit from their team effort.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Theme and Subject</h4>
                There are no restrictions to the final project's theme or subject as long as it covers the required scope. However, a reasoned justification of your choice will be required.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Scope</h4>
                The project scope should warrantee the need to use rich media (text, images, video, etc), and an original, non-trivial implementation of presentation and interactivity using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and JQuery. Viability of scope will require approval upon proposal review.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Design</h4>
                Draw a detailed flow diagram with wireframe pencil thumbnails on paper to outline a tentative sitemap, including a layout proposal for all of the site's sections and interactive components. Explain your design decisions; why are they necessary? how do they benefit the presentation of your content?
            </p>
        
            <p>
                <h4>Research</h4>
                Based on theme, subject, scope, and design requirements, students should present research on current and state-of-the-art related websites, together with an assessment on what can be improved, incorporated or changed from all these references.
