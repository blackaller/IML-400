            And no later than the next day was Teirnyon equipped, and two other
            knights with him.  And the boy, as a fourth in their company, went
            with them upon the horse which Teirnyon had given him.  And they
            journeyed towards Narberth, and it was not long before they reached
            that place.  And as they drew near to the palace, they beheld
            Rhiannon sitting beside the horseblock.  And when they were opposite
            to her, "Chieftain," said she, "go not further thus, I will bear
            every one of you into the palace, and this is my penance for slaying
            my own son and devouring him."  "Oh, fair lady," said Teirnyon,
            "think not that I will be one to be carried upon thy back."  "Neither
            will I," said the boy.  "Truly, my soul," said Teirnyon, "we will not
            go."  So they went forward to the palace, and there was great joy at
            their coming.  And at the palace a feast was prepared, because Pywll
            was come back from the confines of Dyved.  And they went into the
            hall and washed, and Pwyll rejoiced to see Teirnyon.  And in this
            order they sat.  Teirnyon between Pwyll and Rhiannon, and Teirnyon's
            two companions on the other side of Pwyll, with the boy between them.
            And after meat they began to carouse and to discourse.  And
            Teirnyon's discourse was concerning the adventure of the mare and the
            boy, and how he and his wife had nursed and reared the child as their
            own.  "And behold here is thy son, lady," said Teirnyon.  "And
            whosoever told that lie concerning thee, has done wrong.  And when I
            heard of thy sorrow, I was troubled and grieved.  And I believe that
            there is none of this host who will not perceive that the boy is the
            son of Pwyll," said Teirnyon.  "There is none," said they all, "who
            is not certain thereof."  "I declare to Heaven," said Rhiannon, "that
            if this be true, there is indeed an end to my trouble."  "Lady," said
            Pendaran Dyved, "well hast thou named thy son Pryderi, {3} and well
            becomes him the name of Pryderi son of Pwyll Chief of Annwvyn."
            "Look you," said Rhiannon, "will not his own name become him better?"
            "What name has he?" asked Pendaran Dyved.  "Gwri Wallt Euryn is the
            name that we gave him."  "Pryderi," said Pendaran, "shall his name
            be."  "It were more proper," said Pwyll, "that the boy should take
            his name from the word his mother spoke when she received the joyful
            tidings of him."  And thus was it arranged.
