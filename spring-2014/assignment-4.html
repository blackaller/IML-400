            <h2>Assignment 4: Storytelling and Multiple Page Navigation</h2>
            <h2>Individual Assignment</h2>
        
            <p>
                Present a story with separate episodes in different HTML files.
            </p>

            <p>
                Students should use CSS to design and implement a navigation scheme that allows users to seamlessly browse through any point in the story.
            </p>

            <p>
                Minimum episodes: 4. Each episode should have it's own HTML file.
            </p>

            <p>
                Students are free to do whatever they want in terms of visual design, theme and tone of the story. Everything is allowed as long as it tells a story. Students can use material written by others as long as they properly cite their source.
            </p>
            <h2>Additional Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                From now on, we are going to require that each one of your HTML documents follows coding standards. The following HTML tags and their specified properties are required to be present in all your HTML documents:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html#the-doctype" target="blank">&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html#html-element" target="blank">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html#head" target="blank">&lt;head&gt;</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html#encoding" target="blank">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can look at <a href="view-source:http://storm.usc.edu/~black/IML-400/tabs-tutorial/" target="blank">this source code</a> for an example on how to use these tags and properties (warning: if you are not using chrome, this link will open the actual page instead of the source).
            </p>
            <p>
                And just as a random note, here is a nice <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref">compilation of all special characters available to HTML5</a> &Hat;&lowbar;&Hat;. Can you tell me when are special characters actually necessary? When should we use use special character encoding versus the actual character? Inspect the source of this two seemingly identical symbols to see what I mean: <span class="highlight">&copy;</span><span class="highlight">Â©</span>. Why are there two different ways of doing this? Does the actual character always work? Here is an interesting case: <span class="highlight">&lt;br /&gt;</span>. What if I use the actual characters to write the same thing? <br /> o_O An answer to this question will get you extra points.
            </p>

            <h2>Due Dates</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="due-date">Web page: Monday, February 10th, 9:00am.</span> Students are expected to build a website and deploy it to their Storm Server.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>Readings</h2>
                <ul>

                    <li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html" target="blank">Dive Into HTML5 Semantics</a>. You don't have to read this. Use it as a guide to set up your HTML documents following coding standards.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Students should deploy a simple webpage with some thoughts about their readings and link it to their class index page.

            <p>
                <h2>Readings Due Date</h2>
