            <h2>Assignment 9: Final Project Landing Page</h2>
            <p>
                Individual assignment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's define a Landing Page as the content presented to the user once they visit a URL. In the case of a single-page design, this will be the content filling the browser window prior to user interaction.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This assignment requires the implementation of a first iteration of the Final Project Landing Page. All static content should be provided, as well as functional hyperlinks to placeholder pages or, in the case of a single page design, placeholder sections. Animations and effects are not required.
            </p>

                Next week we will host guest lecturer <a href="http://kevindriscoll.info/" target="blank">Kevin Driscoll</a>. Kevin is a Digital Archeologist and a PhD student here at USC. He will tell us about his research on Ted Nelson and Xanadu, a failed project that once had a chance to become an alternate reality for what we now call the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be two required readings in preparation for this lecture:
