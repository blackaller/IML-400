In reading Vannevar Bush's essay As We May Think, the author denotes the necessary changes that "men of science" needed to make in terms of goals and achievement during World War II.  This war called for a need of scientists to come together for a "common cause," which is to create "strange destructive gadgets" in order to aid the efforts of defeating enemies.  However with the war coming to a close, Bush urges scientists to refocus themselves and work towards using science for the betterment of mankind and the advancement of knowledge.  This reading provides quite a refreshing point of view in terms of the purpose that scientists should fulfill immediately following the completion of World War II.  There is no call for further creation of destructive technologies nor is there a call for the advancement of technology for the sake of commercialization and mass consumption.  For instance, the latest models of Apple products become more and more advanced and improved with each version released; however, there is a high commercial price and high economic demand associated with these developments.  In the essay, Bush urges for change in a tone that appears to be remorseful for the destructive, yet necessary goals achieved by scientists during the war, but also hopeful for what these and future scientists can achieve through striving for extending the powers of mankind's mind rather than his physical powers.
In the introduction of the 10 Print reading, code is introduced as "a peculiar kind of text, written, maintained, and modified by programmers to make a machine operate" and is not just functional, abstract, and mathematical as those who are not familiar with code (such as myself) often view it.  While it seems that code is very mathematical and straightforward, the reading suggests that this is quite a superficial way to look at code.  In fact, the reading notes that there is a much more "historical and critical" element to coding particularly with early code patterns and programming.  This provides a reason as to why codes need to be critically analyzed.
